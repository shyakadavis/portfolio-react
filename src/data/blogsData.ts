      There are no guides for this land
      There are no times for the plans that you make
      Roads that you stray, don't matter what you do
      There's a toll left to pay
      Don't matter where you move, where you go it ain't safe
      So you should make it home in your skin where you lay
      Instead it's big Birkin bags for the pain
      Ice out the chain
      Credit swipe, charge it to the game
      I talk it up like a saint
      Gold on the rings
      How long 'til I fade
      How much did it take
      Enzo, tryna switch the lane
      So-so's tryna hunt the bank

      Lose my mind tryna find out what I want
      Losin' time stuck on this route to be alone
      Losin' friends that's runnin' in
      Then they come and go
      Do what you want I'm on a mission of my own
      It's whatever, thought you knew me better
      I let you in now you see the mess you wearin'
      Angels in my heels while I deal with all my devils
      Tryna fight the feels
      Holdin' in all the weather
      Don't get better but
      I'll keep my head
